### Data usage and analytical structure

Part A is conducted using the sequencing data generated from your own wet lab experiment.  
The objective is to directly compare how different physical DNA treatments (Control, Vortex, Needle, Temperature stress) influence sequencing performance metrics, including read length distribution, sequencing yield, and base quality before and after filtering.  
This section establishes the causal link between laboratory manipulation and sequencing outcomes.



Parts B and C extend the analysis to mapping, structural variant detection, and biological interpretation.  
Because full mapping and variant calling workflows on complete raw datasets are computationally intensive and require extended runtime on HPC infrastructure, a pre-processed and region-restricted dataset derived from previous sequencing runs is used for these sections.  



This ensures that all students can complete the advanced analytical workflow within the allocated practical session while working with high-quality, reproducible example data suitable for interpretation in IGV and downstream biological analysis.

Together, Part A and Parts B–C form a coherent analytical progression:  
from experimental manipulation and quality assessment (wet-to-sequencing outcomes) to genomic localization and biological interpretation (sequencing-to-function).



# Part A. Read quality check (Core Activity)

## Overview
### Objective

To quantitatively evaluate how different physical DNA treatments (Control, Vortex, Needle shearing, and Temperature extreme) influence long-read sequencing performance by comparing read length distribution, sequencing yield, and base quality metrics before and after quality filtering.

### Experimental origin of the sequencing data

The FASTQ files analyzed in this section originate from four treatments performed during the wet laboratory session:

- Control  
- Vortex  
- Needle shearing  
- Temperature extreme (freeze–thaw stress)

Following DNA extraction, concentrations were quantified using Qubit fluorometry.  
Samples were normalized to equal DNA mass per barcode, barcoded individually, pooled, and sequenced using Oxford Nanopore technology.






## Connect to Sigma2 and the prepare the tools


🚀In the Terminal/Command prompt, go to Sigma2 and your directory there.

[Let's review how to do so](https://github.com/TheMEMOLab/Bio326-NMBU/blob/main/Doc/HPC-101-WorkingWithSigma2.md)



```{bash,eval=FALSE}
ssh yourID@saga.sigma2.no
```


Let's make a directory for analysis and enter in it.

```{bash,eval=FALSE}
mkdir analysis # make directory "analysis"
cd analysis # set the current directory "analysis"

```


Now, you will inspect the fastq file from your experiment, which contains Nanopore read information.



### DNA Quantification and Barcoding Overview

Before proceeding with the analysis, review the metadata corresponding to your assigned group.

Please identify:

- Your **Sample ID**
- The corresponding **Treatment condition**
- The assigned **Barcode ID**

You can find the complete overview of samples and barcodes in [the shared spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VvkG2FId57kSaE9hbZ7QUlzNcrFbAd9GI68F0T_QA5I/edit?gid=0#gid=0)


Confirm that the FASTQ file you are working with matches your assigned barcode and treatment condition before running NanoPlot.

---

## Explore the structure of a FASTQ file

### Inspect the file structure

Open your FASTQ file and examine its structure.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
zcat YourSample.fq.gz | head -20
```


FASTQ format uses 4 lines per read:
1. Header
2. Sequence
3. "+"
4. Quality string


FASTQ files contain both nucleotide sequences and per-base [quality scores](https://help.basespace.illumina.com/files-used-by-basespace/quality-scores)

- by [Illumina Knowledge](https://knowledge.illumina.com/software/general/software-general-reference_material-list/000002211)

---

###  Count total lines and calculate number of reads

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
zcat YourSample.fq.gz | wc -l
```


FASTQ uses 4 lines per read.

You can calculate reads with:

    LINES=$(zcat YourSample.fq.gz | wc -l)
    echo $((LINES / 4))


The total number of reads reflects **sequencing yield.**
This will later be compared between treatments and after filtering.


---


### Compare quality positions

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
zcat YourSample.fq.gz | sed -n 4p | cut -c 1-5
zcat YourSample.fq.gz | sed -n 4p | cut -c 21-25
```

Quality scores are encoded using Phred+33.
Quality may vary along the read due to sequencing chemistry.

---


### Extract one read longer than 10 kb

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
zcat YourSample.fq.gz | awk 'NR%4==2 && length($0) > 10000 {print; exit}'
```

Long reads are a key advantage of Nanopore sequencing.
Read length distribution will later be compared across treatments.








## Quality check by Nanoplot

The original fastq files may contain low quality reads. In this step, we will use "Nanoplot" to see the quality and lentgh of each read.


Make a slurm script to conduct the quality check on the sample file like below and run it. 


[Review: make a slurm script and run it by sbatch](https://github.com/TheMEMOLab/Bio326-NMBU/blob/main/Doc/HPC-101-WorkingWithSigma2.md)



```{bash,eval=FALSE}

```




Nanoplot will generate the result files, named "before_filter_A1"xxx. Lets look into them...

<details>
<summary><strong>How to interpret these metrics</strong></summary>

- Compare mean vs median read length. A large difference suggests a skewed distribution with a long tail of very long reads.  
- N50 reflects the read length at which 50% of the total bases are contained in reads of that length or longer.  
- Compare mean read quality and median read quality. Differences may indicate heterogeneity in read quality distribution.


Together, these metrics capture the trade-off between yield and quality before and after filtering.

This script activates a Conda environment (Your toolkit that Arturo pre-assembled) on a computing cluster:

1. Load required modules

module load StdEnv → Loads the standard environment.

module load Miniconda3/23.10.0-1 → Loads Miniconda, a lightweight Conda
distribution.

2. Activate Conda

source ${EBROOTMINICONDA3}/bin/activate → Activates Miniconda.

conda activate EUK_DRY → Activates a specific Conda environment for the project.

3.  Confirm activation

echo "Working with this $CONDA_PREFIX environment ..." → Indicates the currently active Conda environment.


**Parameters**

-l,  Filter on a minimum read length

-q, Filter on a minimum average read quality score

In this case, we are removing reads lower than quality score 12 and shorter than 1000 bases.

If you are ambitious, please adjust the filtering parameters and see how they change the result.

**(In that case, do not forget to name the result files differently.)**


| Q Score < 12 | High error rate |
| Length < 1000bp | Too short for meaningful mapping |

# Part B. Mapping to the reference genome 


### Objective

To understand the core logic of read mapping and structural variant calling by running (or inspecting) a minimal long-read pipeline:
1) map reads to a reference genome,  
2) generate a sorted/indexed BAM file,  
3) call structural variants (SVs) into a VCF file,  
4) inspect variant records and interpret key fields (SVTYPE, SVLEN, GT).




![](https://github.com/mariesaitou/Bio326/raw/master/docs/assets/BIO326-genome/Slide14.png){width=90%}
### What is Read Mapping?  
- Aligning sequencing reads to a reference genome.  
- Essential for variant detection to find out which region is different from your sample and standard sample.  



## Run Minimap and map the reads to the reference genome


```{bash,eval=FALSE}
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=Sniffles # sensible name for the job
#SBATCH --mem=12G 
#SBATCH --ntasks=1   
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8
#SBATCH --output=mapping 
#SBATCH --account=nn9987k
#SBATCH --time=20:00  

##Activate conda environment
module load StdEnv
module load Miniconda3/23.10.0-1
source ${EBROOTMINICONDA3}/bin/activate 

echo "Working with this $CONDA_PREFIX environment ..."


minimap2 -t 8 -a /cluster/projects/nn9987k/BIO326-2025/Bos_taurus.ARS-UCD1.3.dna.toplevel.fa.gz  /cluster/projects/nn9987k/BIO326-2025/day2/cleaned_control.fastq.gz > control.sam


# convert the sam file to bam format
samtools view -S -b control.sam > control_temp.bam

## sort the bam file
samtools sort control_temp.bam -o control.bam

# index the bam file
samtools index -M  control.bam

# Variant Calling using Sniffles
sniffles --input  control.bam --vcf control.vcf


```



</details> <details> <summary><strong>What each step is doing (click)</strong></summary>

minimap2 ... > control.sam
Maps long reads to the reference genome and writes alignments in SAM format.

samtools view ... > control_temp.bam
Converts SAM to BAM (compressed binary alignment).

samtools sort ... -o control.bam
Sorts alignments by coordinate, required for efficient viewing and downstream tools.

samtools index ... control.bam
Creates an index file enabling random access to regions.

sniffles ... --vcf control.vcf
Calls structural variants from the read alignments and outputs VCF.

</details>



### What is Variant Calling?  
- Identifying differences between sequenced DNA and a reference genome.  
- Important for studying mutations and genetic variation.  
[bam and sam format](https://labs.epi2me.io/reviewing-bam/)

Note: Mapping and variant calling is time consuming, but you can find the output file here: /cluster/projects/nn9987k/BIO326-2025/day2/control.vcf


Now you got the variant file!

## Investigate the variants


Copy the vcf in your directory

```{bash,eval=FALSE}
qlogin 

cp /cluster/projects/nn9987k/BIO326-2025/day2/control.vcf  control.vcf 


```

Look inside the vcf

```{bash,eval=FALSE}
# INFO field

grep '^##' control.vcf | tail -n 20

# variants
grep -v '^##' control.vcf | more


```


![](https://github.com/mariesaitou/Bio326/raw/master/docs/assets/Bio326-2023/image11.png){width=80%}

Important parameters


1	16849578 : location of the variant 

SVTYPE=DEL;SVLEN=-60 : size and type of the variant

0/1 : genotype 

(you can open a vcf file in notepad, excel etc.)


| **field** | **Explanation** |
|------------|----------------|
| CHROM | Chromosome name |
| POS | Variant position |
| REF | Reference allele (reference version) |
| ALT | Alternate allele (your sample's version) |


Now you have variants! Lets see which genes are affected by the variants.

Since there are many variants it can be difficult to know where to start

Let's select a random variant for yourself to investigate.


```{bash,eval=FALSE}
#Check the number of variant in the file

NBVAR=$(grep -v '^##' control.vcf | wc -l)

## sample a random number

RANDOMVAR=$(echo $((RANDOM % $NBVAR + 1)))

## let's check the variant sampled

grep -v '^##' control.vcf |  sed -n ${RANDOMVAR}p

```



# Part C. Estimate the effect of variants (Local)

## Overview

In this practical, you will explore high-confidence structural variants (SVs) detected from long-read sequencing data in two samples (2024 and 2025).  

The dataset has been reduced to chromosome 13 around selected SVs to ensure fast loading in Integrative Genome Viewer(IGV).

You will:
- Visualize structural variants in IGV  
- Compare genotypes between two samples  
- Interpret read-level evidence  
- Examine gene overlap  
- Investigate biological function  
- (Optional) Produce a short structured report

1. Copy a coordinate (for example: `13:46710350`) into the IGV search bar.  
2. Compare the 2024 and 2025 BAM tracks.  
3. Determine:
   - Do the genotypes differ between samples?
   - Does the variant overlap an exon, intron, or intergenic region?



## For your report assignment (optional)

Select one structural variant locus from the table provided and investigate it in IGV.
Report the genomic coordinates, variant type and size, genotype comparison between the 2024 and 2025 samples, whether the variant overlaps any genes, and briefly discuss the potential functional consequence for the affected gene.

## Example views 

**Example locus**

**Sniffles2.INS.1F6MC — 13:46710350–46710351 — 51 bp insertion — ENSBTAG00000006531 (DIP2C)**


![](images/image_2026_2.png){width=80%}

This locus corresponds to a 51 bp insertion at position 46,710,350 on chromosome 13. 

In IGV, the 2024 sample shows continuous read alignment across the site with no consistent breakpoint or inserted sequence, indicating a reference genotype at this position. 

In contrast, the 2025 sample displays multiple independent reads containing the same inserted sequence at the identical coordinate, with split alignment patterns and clear insertion labeling in IGV, supporting the presence of the insertion allele. 

According to the gene annotation track, the variant lies within the ENSBTAG00000006531 locus, corresponding to DIP2C. If located within an exon, a 51 bp insertion could alter the coding sequence while preserving the reading frame, potentially modifying protein structure. 



**Example locus**

**Sniffles2.BND.2F6MC — 13:75795925–75795926 — BND — ENSBTAG00000013114**

![](images/image_2026_3.png){width=80%}


Sniffles2.BND.2F6MC — chr13:75,795,925–75,795,926 — BND — ENSBTAG00000013114

At this locus, compare the two samples directly.


In the 2024 sample, read coverage is uniform, mismatches are scattered, and there is no clustering of discordant alignments, indicating absence of a structural rearrangement. 

In 2025, focus on the central region where the reads form a dense, colorful block. The vertical colored lines indicate many mismatches concentrated in the same short interval. Coverage is locally elevated, and multiple reads show discordant alignment in the same position. When many reads change relative to the reference at the exact same coordinates, this is not random sequencing error. 


This pattern is typical of an inversion or a highly divergent sequence present in 2025 but absent in 2024. The key points to examine are therefore: uniform vs. clustered signal, normal vs. elevated coverage, and isolated mismatches vs. consistent changes across many reads.

The locus overlaps ENSBTAG00000013114. A breakend event within a gene may disrupt coding sequence continuity or regulatory structure, depending on whether the breakpoint falls within an exon or intron.
